Developer's Guide
=================

This section of the documentation concerns both developers who would like to
use TinyLisp, and persons who are interested in how TinyLisp works. For the
latter group, this section is quite verbose and didactic. Remember: TinyLisp is
tiny! Feel free to refer to the source if you are confused.
